All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.4

### Improved
- Hardened tab-restore logic: if internal tab-creation API fails, the plugin falls back to opening the previous file in a normal new tab (best-effort, avoids hard crashes).
- Clarified documentation and KR/EN inline comments for best-effort internals and panel-isolated behavior.

## 1.0.3
- Initial public release.
